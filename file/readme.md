In the first step we should resize images because our images are in different size.
We change size of pictures and we got the size of pictures 100 * 100 pixels. Actually for comfort we change the pictures to tensor and we save them. In train procces we use convolutional models. At the first we use pretrained model but it didn't work so we designed a model from scratch.
